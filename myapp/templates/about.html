<h3>About {{ username }}</h3>
<p>The core component of Jinja is the Environment. It contains important shared variables like configuration, filters, tests, globals and others. Instances of this class may be modified if they are not shared and if no template was loaded so far. Modifications on environments after the first template was loaded will lead to surprising effects and undefined behavior.</p>
